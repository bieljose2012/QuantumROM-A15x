1:  **For download and rom mod:**
```bash
sudo chmod +x mod_rom_1.sh
```
```bash
sudo bash mod_rom_1.sh DEVICE_MODEL CSC IMEI
```

2:  **For previous downloaded rom mod:**
Run setup_directories.sh to create the directories. Then, copy the firmware ZIP file into the fw_download folder. DEVICE_MODEL refers to the firmware file name. After copying, rename the firmware ZIP to match the actual device model name, for example, SM-A225F.zip. In the command line, DEVICE_MODEL should be the firmware file name without the .zip extension.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./scripts/setup_directories.sh &&
sudo bash ./scripts/setup_directories.sh
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x mod_rom_2.sh
```
```bash
sudo bash mod_rom_2.sh DEVICE_MODEL

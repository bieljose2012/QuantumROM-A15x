1:  **Download and modify the ROM:**
```bash
sudo chmod +x mod_rom_1.sh
```
```bash
sudo bash mod_rom_1.sh DEVICE_MODEL CSC IMEI
```

2:  **Modifying a previously downloaded ROM:**
Run ```setup_directories.sh``` to create the necessary directories.

Copy the firmware ZIP file into the ```fw_download``` folder.

```DEVICE_MODEL``` refers to the firmware file name. Rename the firmware ZIP to match your actual device model, for example: ```SM-A225F.zip```.

In the command line, use the firmware file name without the .zip extension as ```DEVICE_MODEL```.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./scripts/setup_directories.sh &&
sudo bash ./scripts/setup_directories.sh
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x mod_rom_2.sh
```
```bash
sudo bash mod_rom_2.sh DEVICE_MODEL
```
